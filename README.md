# Unbrickable_v2

## History
Unbrickable_v2 is da project based on my capstone projekt, which I did in my AWS Cloud Developer Bootcamp.
The goal is to refactor Unbrickable to a serverless architecture in AWS.

Unbrickable calls the API of bricklink in order to gather the price of several Lego minifigures, as well as their different parts. Then, unbrickable calculates whether there is a profit margin when buying the parts, assemble them to a minifigure and sell the minifigure.
